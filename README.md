# Machine_Learning_Unsupervised_learning
    Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that looks for previously undetected patterns in a data set with no pre-existing labels and with a minimum of human supervision.
       The data given to unsupervised algorithms is not labelled, which means only the input variables (x) are given with no corresponding output variables. In unsupervised learning, the algorithms are left to discover interesting structures in the data on their own.
        In some pattern recognition problems, the training data consists of a set of input vectors x without any corresponding target values. The goal in such unsupervised learning problems may be to discover groups of similar examples within the data, where it is called clustering, or to determine how the data is distributed in the space, known as density estimation. To put forward in simpler terms, for a n-sampled space x1 to xn, true class labels are not provided for each sample, hence known as learning without teacher.
        Clustering can be considered the most important unsupervised learning problem; so, as every other problem of this kind, it deals with finding a structure in a collection of unlabeled data. A loose definition of clustering could be “the process of organizing objects into groups whose members are similar in some way”. A cluster is therefore a collection of objects which are “similar” between them and are “dissimilar” to the objects belonging to other clusters.
