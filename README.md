# Machine_Learning_Unsupervised_learning
    Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that looks for previously undetected patterns in a data set with no pre-existing labels and with a minimum of human supervision.
       The data given to unsupervised algorithms is not labelled, which means only the input variables (x) are given with no corresponding output variables. In unsupervised learning, the algorithms are left to discover interesting structures in the data on their own.
