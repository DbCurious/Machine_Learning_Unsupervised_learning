Apriori Algorithm 

      1.It is a Machine Learning algorithm which is used to gain insight into the structured relationships between different items involved.
      2.Apriori algorithm finds the most frequent itemsets or elements in a transaction database and identifies association rules between the items 
      3.The most prominent practical application of the algorithm is to recommend products based on the products already present in the user’s cart.
      4.The algorithm uses a “bottom-up” approach, where frequent subsets are extended one item at once (candidate generation) and groups of candidates are 
        tested against the data.The algorithm terminates when no further successful rules can be derived from the data.
